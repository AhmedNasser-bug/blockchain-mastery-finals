## 🧬 Workflow: Adding Your Own Material

This guide details exactly how to take this project and make it your own, from the very first step of cloning to choosing how you input your data.  

### 🛑 Step 1: Cloning the Repository
First, you need the codebase on your local machine.
1.  **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mold-v2.git`
2.  **Navigate**: `cd mold-v2`
3.  **Install**: `npm install`
4.  **Verify**: Run `npm run dev` and open `localhost:4321` to see the base app.

### 🛣️ Step 2: Choose Your Path (Manual vs. Workflow)

You have two options for adding your study material:

#### Option A: The "Manual Artisan" (JSON)
*Best for: Users who want 100% control and are comfortable with JSON syntax.*

1.  Navigate to `src/data/subjects/`.
2.  Create a new folder (e.g., `OrganicChemistry`).
3.  Create `meta.json` inside it (copy the structure from `Web Programming/meta.json`).
4.  Create `questions.json` and manually type your questions following the schema below.
5.  **Pros**: precision, no external dependencies.
6.  **Cons**: tedious, prone to comma errors.

#### Option B: The "AI Workflow" (Recommended)
*Best for: Rapidly converting notes/PDFs into a playable game.*

1.  **Prepare your source**: Have your notes ready as text or a PDF.
2.  **Use an AI Tool (ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude)**:
    *   **Prompt**: "Convert these notes into a JSON question bank for a quiz app. Use the following schema: `[{ id: 'q1', type: 'mcq', question: '...', options: [...], correct: 0, explanation: '...' }]`."
    *   *Tip*: Ask for 20 questions at a time to avoid truncation.
3.  **Validate**: Copy the JSON output.
4.  **Paste**: Create `questions.json` in your subject folder and paste the result.

### ⚠️ Possible Failures & Fallbacks

**1. "The App Crushed / Blank Screen!"**
*   **Cause**: Invalid JSON. A missing comma `,` or unclosed bracket `}` is usually the culprit.
*   **Fallback**: Paste your JSON into [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to find the syntax error.

**2. "My Subject Doesn't Show Up"**
*   **Cause**: Missing or Invalid `meta.json`.
*   **Fallback**: Ensure `meta.json` exists in your folder and has valid `config` and `subject` fields. Check the console for "Error loading subject".

**3. "Questions Are Out of Order"**
*   **Cause**: Standard modes shuffle questions.
*   **Fallback**: Use **Full Revision Mode** if you need strict sequential ordering (e.g., for storytelling or cumulative logic).

**4. "Images Aren't Loading"**
*   **Cause**: Incorrect paths or missing files in `public/`.
*   **Fallback**: Use absolute paths starting with `/` (e.g., `/images/cell_diagram.png`) and ensure the file is physically in the `public` folder.

## 📚 How to Add a New Subject ("Mold")

A **Mold** is a self-contained subject package (e.g., *Blockchain*, *Web Programming*). To add a new subject, you simply create a folder and add JSON files.

### 1. Create the Directory
Go to `src/data/subjects/` and create a new folder. The folder name itself (e.g., `MySubject`) is used as the internal ID.
> **Example**: `src/data/subjects/WebProgramming/`

### 2. Create `meta.json` (Required)
This file governs how the subject appears in the menu. It **MUST** contain both `subject` and `config` objects.

**File Path**: `.../[YourFolder]/meta.json`
```json
{
  "subject": {
    "id": "my-subject-id",
    "name": "My Subject Name"
  },
  "config": {
    "title": "My Subject Name",
    "description": "A short description displayed on the card.",
    "themeColor": "#FFD700",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Add Content Files
The system automatically loads files starting with specific prefixes.

#### A. `questions.json` (The Question Bank)
This file drives **Speedrun**, **Blitz**, **Hardcore**, **Practice**, and **Full Revision** modes.

**File Path**: `.../[YourFolder]/questions.json`
```json
[
  {
    "id": "q1",
    "type": "mcq", 
    "category": "Basic Concepts",
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Paris is the capital.",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "relatedTerms": ["Capital_City"]
  },
  {
    "id": "q2",
    "type": "multi",
    "category": "Advanced",
    "question": "Select all prime numbers.",
    "options": ["2", "4", "5", "9"],
    "correct": [0, 2],
    "explanation": "2 and 5 are prime.",
    "difficulty": "Hard"
  },
  {
    "id": "q3",
    "type": "tf",
    "category": "Logic",
    "question": "True or False: The sky is usually green.",
    "correct": false,
    "explanation": "It's blue.",
    "difficulty": "Easy"
  }
]
```
> **Important**: `difficulty` must be one of: `"Easy"`, `"Medium"`, `"Hard"`.

#### B. `terminology.json` (The Encyclopedia)
Defines terms for the Encyclopedia view and auto-generates questions for **Full Revision** mode.

**File Path**: `.../[YourFolder]/terminology.json`
```json
{
  "API": {
    "Category": "Software",
    "Meaning": "Application Programming Interface.",
    "Analogy": "A waiter at a restaurant.",
    "Where_it_is_used": "Software integration.",
    "When_it_is_used": "Connecting two systems.",
    "Pros": ["Modular", "Reusable"],
    "Cons": ["Overhead"]
  },
  "HTTP": {
    "Category": "Protocol",
    "Meaning": "Hypertext Transfer Protocol.",
    "Analogy": "The language of the web."
  }
}
```

#### C. `flashcards.json` (Memorization)
Manually defined flashcards for **Flashcard** mode.

**File Path**: `.../[YourFolder]/flashcards.json`
```json
[
  {
    "front": "What does SQL stand for?",
    "back": "Structured Query Language",
    "type": "term" 
  }
]
```
> `type` can be `"term"` or `"question"`.

### 4. Verify
After adding these files, simply run `npm run dev`. The new subject will appear on the dashboard automatically.

## 🎓 Full Revision Mode

**Full Revision Mode** is designed for pedagogical mastery. Unlike other modes that randomize questions, this mode:
1.  **Strict Order**: Presents questions in the exact order they are defined in `questions.json`. This allows for a "bottom-up" learning experience where concepts build upon each other.
2.  **Terminology Integration**: After all standard questions are completed, the system will present every term from `terminology.json` as a verification question.
3.  **100% Mastery**: The goal is to verify knowledge of the *entire* material without gaps.

> **Note**: For Subject Creators, ensure your `questions.json` is ordered logically from easiest/foundational to hardest/complex for this mode to be most effective.

## 🎮 How to Add a New Game Mode

Game modes (e.g., "Speedrun", "Hardcore") are defined in the code to control how questions are selected and presented.

### Step 1: Open definition file
Open `src/data/subjects/Subject.ts`.

### Step 2: Add to `SUBJECT_MODES` Dictionary
Locate the `SUBJECT_MODES` export and add your new mode configuration.

```typescript
export const SUBJECT_MODES: Record<string, GameModeConfig> = {
    // ... existing modes ...
    
    mymode: {
        id: 'mymode',
        label: 'My Custom Mode',
        description: 'Describe your mode here',
        icon: '🚀', // Emoji or icon code
        
        // componentId determines the UI screen to use:
        // 'QuizScreen' -> Standard multiple choice/TF quiz layout
        // 'FlashcardScreen' -> Front/Back card swiping layout
        componentId: 'QuizScreen', 
        
        // Zod schema to validate data for this mode
        schema: z.array(QuestionSchema),
        
        // AI Prompt strategy (if using AI generation features)
        promptStrategy: (context) => `
            GOAL: Generate questions for My Custom Mode.
            STRATEGY: Focus on ...
            CONTEXT: ${context}
        `
    }
};
```

### Step 3: Verify
Save the file. Your new mode will automatically appear in the "Select Mode" section on the Home Screen for every subject.
