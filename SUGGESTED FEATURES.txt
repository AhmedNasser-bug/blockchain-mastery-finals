SUGGESTED FEATURES
1.Flashcard system rehaul that includes 
- Flashcard hinting depending on user's exp (easy, medium, hard... of the card itself)
- Flashcard show order depends on user's exp on the card, the more exp the user has on the card, the less likely the card is to be shown, the less exp the user has on the card, the more likely the card is to be shown, 
- Again, this finishing the feature MUST not break any existing subjects and must not break any other component and must not change the required schema of the flashcards. 
2. Practical mode and image mcq's 
- Figures folder in the subject folder interface
- Practical question type that uses figures and images in the answers adn the questions
- For the existing subjects, add a template figures folder in the subject folder interface and add a template question type in the questions.json file
- Add a template image mcq question type in the questions.json file for existing subjects so they don't break 
3. Add time estimates for finishing a game mode relative to player's previous runs on the game mode, The estimate should only appear inside the mode screen itself 
4.Add survival mode that makes you lose once you pass a specific amount of time for each question, the time is relative to player's performance stats, the more exp the player has, the less time they have to answer each question.
5. Add a feature that allows the player to save their progress and resume it later.
6. Add a feature that allows the player to play the game offline.
7. Add exp and leveling system that rewards the player for playing the game and completing quizzes, but the amount of exp gained from a specific category slows down as the player progresses through the game, the amount of exp gained from a specific category also depends on the player's performance stats.
8. Add a profile button that allows the player to view their progress and stats and exp progression rate for each category.
- It encapsulates The data of the player and the stats of the player. that are already shown on the main screen
- Its interface on the main screen should expose the high scores and the amount of awards
- It should be visible to the player and act as a subconscious motivation for the player to continue playing the game.
9. Add Full revision mode that bottoms up the entire material in a perfect pedagogical order of the material.
- ex: instead of asking the player 120 separated questions, the questions go on by the order of the material instead,
- the question should lead the player with perfect bottom up understanding of the material to ensure a 100% pass rate of the Full revision mode.
- Uses the same questions from questions.ts but in order not random, so add the disclaimer of the order importance on the subject adding tutorial on readme.md, append the terminology questions to the mode question set, again, also in order. So the question set used in the mode are [Questions, Terminoloy] in order
